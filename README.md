# digit_recognizer
Using the MNIST dataset, I'm constructing and training a 2 layer neural network to recognize handwritten digits. I'm not using any frameworks, just math and numpy on Python, but I'm currently working towards better understanding vector calculus before I derive the formulas for gradient descent.
